- **Purpose**: Python 3.12 CLI that performs harsh AI-assisted code reviews and optional test generation using Claude Sonnet 4.5. It inspects git diffs, gathers AST/code metrics, and formats actionable findings. Secondary commands initialize project scaffolding and report configuration/status.
- **Core components**: Click CLI in `src/code_reviewer/cli.py`, configuration/dataclass loader in `config.py`, git diff utilities in `git_analyzer.py`, AST + metrics collector in `ast_analyzer.py`, main reviewer orchestration in `code_reviewer.py`, test generation helper in `test_generator.py`, and prompt template loader in `prompts/__init__.py`. Entry-point script is `code-reviewer` (defined in `pyproject.toml`).
- **External services**: Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude Sonnet 4.5 API access. Uses GitPython for repository access and Radon for code complexity metrics. Note: MCP tools (Firecrawl, Context7) are used during development for documentation research but are NOT integrated into the final application.
- **Dependency / build tooling**: Managed via `pyproject.toml` (Hatch build backend). Recommended workflow uses `uv sync` / `uv pip install -e .` for dev installs.
- **Notable behaviors**: Review command enforces strict exit codes (2 for critical, 1 for high severity) suitable for CI/CD pipelines. Test generation analyzes existing project patterns before writing tests. Prompts are externalized to `src/code_reviewer/prompts/*.txt` files for easy customization.
